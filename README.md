Purpose of these courses is to give you a good start in your "machine learning" learning journey. Motivation for developing a separate resource as this are as follows 

* Creating a single destination for beginners [and myself] with proper sequence of resources as much as possible 
* Many very good resources either assume certain level of pre-existing knowledge or have additional overwhelming details without much context, both of which can be a hurdle for a beginner. Goal of this here is to enable you to evntually graduate to a level where these other high level resources start to make sense to you

Each course has multiple sections which usually will have couple of files 

* pdf lessons : this will contain theoretical discussions and ideas for you to study and exercises for you to work on [we are working on adding more exercises with solutions]
* python notebooks : you can download these to your machine and run along or experiment with them with your own data and ideas
* .csv,.py files and other resources : included wherever required

As such you can go through these in any sequence as they fit your requirement in the moment, for an absolute beginner [having some recall of maths studied in school] i will suggest following sequence 

## Basics of Python and Data Processing 

* [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/0.Basics%20of%20Python%20and%20Data%20Processing/0.%20Python%20Programming)

its essential that you run the python notebooks along with these lessons. There is no way you can learn programming with programming. Write code, fail, resolve issues and move on to the next idea. Thats the only way to learn programming. 
* [Data Exploration with numpy and pandas](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/0.Basics%20of%20Python%20and%20Data%20Processing/1.Numpy%20and%20Pandas)

Some example dataset is used here to showcase the functionalities, it might be more fun for you to use these ideas with your own dataset for which you have better context. I will advise you to get a sizable dataset if you are going to replace the example dataset that we are using here
* [Data Visualisation with seaborn](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/0.Basics%20of%20Python%20and%20Data%20Processing/2.%20Data%20Visualisation%20With%20Seaborn)
* [Data Processing Pipeline](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/0.Basics%20of%20Python%20and%20Data%20Processing/3.%20Data%20Processing%20Pipelines%20with%20sklearn)

As far as building actual machine learning models on your data is concerned, i will rate this particular section to be the most important one. Remeber that good data always beats a better algorithm. Do spend good time here, and make sure that you go beyond given examples and build data processing pipelines for your own data

## Machine Learning Fundamentals

* [Intro to Machine Learning](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/1.Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/0.%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning)

goal of this section is to give you some context as to what we are trying to achieve with machine learning models before it becomes all maths and symbols. This grounding and connect that we establish between the business problem and math which follows , i have personally found it to be essential to not getting lost in the mathematical details.
* [Linear Algebra for ML](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/1.Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/1.%20Linear%20Algebra)
* [Calculus for ML](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/1.Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/2.%20Calculus)

both of these section above are not complete courses in linear algebra and calculus; and they shouldnt be in that context either. I have discussed and tried to give you intuition about the concepts in linear algebra and calculus here which get used and utilised in ML in many places and without clarity about these ideas you will feel more and more lost as you progress in ML journey
* [Optimisation for ML](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/1.Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/3.%20Optimisers%20for%20ML)
* [Linear Models](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/1.Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/4.%20Linear%20Models)

As the last section of machine learning fundamentals , it has two goals: 1: bring everything that we have studied so far together to build our first few models. 2: to get you acquanted with the machinery and processes which exists in `sklearn` and elsewhere to help you build your solution. What you learn here can be seamlessely used when we move to more advanced algorithms later on.
