Purpose of these courses is to give you a good start in your "machine learning" learning journey. Motivation for developing a separate resource as this are as follows 

* Creating a single destination for beginners [and myself] with proper sequence of resources as much as possible 
* Many very good resources either assume certain level of pre-existing knowledge or have additional overwhelming details without much context, both of which can be a hurdle for a beginner. Goal of this here is to enable you to eventually graduate to a level where these other high level resources start to make sense to you

Each course has multiple sections which usually will have couple of files 

* pdf lessons : this will contain theoretical discussions and ideas for you to study and exercises for you to work on [we are working on adding more exercises with solutions]
* python notebooks : you can download these to your machine and run along or experiment with them with your own data and ideas
* .csv,.py files and other resources : included wherever required

As such you can go through these in any sequence as they fit your requirement in the moment, for an absolute beginner [having some recall of maths studied in school] i will suggest following sequence 

## 0. Basics of Python and Data Processing 

* [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/0.Basics%20of%20Python%20and%20Data%20Processing/0.%20Python%20Programming)

its essential that you run the python notebooks along with these lessons. There is no way you can learn programming without programming yourself. Write code, fail, resolve issues and move on to the next idea. Thats the only way to learn programming. 
* [Data Exploration with numpy and pandas](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/0.Basics%20of%20Python%20and%20Data%20Processing/1.Numpy%20and%20Pandas)

Some example dataset is used here to showcase the functionalities, it might be more fun for you to use these ideas with your own dataset for which you have better context. I will advise you to get a sizeable dataset if you are going to replace the example dataset that we are using here
* [Data Visualisation with seaborn](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/0.Basics%20of%20Python%20and%20Data%20Processing/2.%20Data%20Visualisation%20With%20Seaborn)
* [Data Processing Pipeline](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/0.Basics%20of%20Python%20and%20Data%20Processing/3.%20Data%20Processing%20Pipelines%20with%20sklearn)

As far as building actual machine learning models on your data is concerned, i will rate this particular section to be the most important one. Remember that good data always beats a better algorithm. Do spend good time here, and make sure that you go beyond given examples and build data processing pipelines for your own data

## 1. Machine Learning Fundamentals

* [Intro to Machine Learning](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/1.Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/0.%20Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning)

goal of this section is to give you some context as to what we are trying to achieve with machine learning models before it becomes all maths and symbols. This grounding and connect that we establish between the business problem and math which follows , i have personally found it to be essential to not getting lost in the mathematical details.
* [Linear Algebra for ML](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/1.Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/1.%20Linear%20Algebra)
* [Calculus for ML](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/1.Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/2.%20Calculus)

both of these section above are not complete courses in linear algebra and calculus; and they shouldn't be used in that context either. I have discussed and tried to give you intuition about the concepts in linear algebra and calculus here which get used and utilised in ML in many places and without clarity about these ideas you will feel more and more lost as you progress in ML journey
* [Optimisation for ML](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/1.Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/3.%20Optimisers%20for%20ML)
* [Linear Models](https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/tree/main/1.Machine%20Learning%20Fundamentals/4.%20Linear%20Models)

As the last section of machine learning fundamentals , it has two goals: 1: bring everything that we have studied so far together to build our first few models. 2: to get you acquainted with the machinery and processes which exists in `sklearn` and elsewhere to help you build your solution. What you learn here can be seamlessly used when we move to more advanced algorithms later on.

Other courses in the pipeline which will appear here : 
* Non Linear Models in Machine Learning
* Unsupervised Learning For Tabular Data
* Introduction to Deep Learning with Keras and Pytorch
* Deep Learning for Images and Sequence Data
* Probability Distributions and Hypothesis Testing

## Some Thoughts on How to learn for aspiring learners 

* Learning is almost never linear. Meaning, things will not make sense to you in same sequence in which you are reading them. Some concepts will click, many at times when you are reading something entirely different. Give yourself that time, be patient. Go through ideas and lessons multiple times.
* When you go through something second time, it makes more sense because you have gathered more context and it becomes easier to connect the dots. Lesson here is that, don't get hung up on one point if  it doesn't make sense. Go through the entire chapter and its quite possible that with greater context; you'll be able to connect the dots better.
* There is absolutely no other way to learn programming than to code yourself . You'll never learn programming by just reading a book or just watching a video .
* While programming, if you remember syntax, it enables you to be faster while you code. But mugging up syntax is not the goal of learning to program. Syntax is something that you'll start to retain more and more of, as and when you spend more and more time coding. Focus more on logic of things .
* Any programming language has an overall theme for doing things in a certain way. Don't get too hung up on why it doesn't behave in exactly the same way you expected it to. Especially when you are at the very beginning of your learning to program curve; its ok to accept few things as `it is the way it is`
* Many chapters will be mathematically heavy , most of the time it'll be difficult to get it all in one go. Keep in mind that, if you understand the mathematics, it makes you more confident as a data scientist . But it's **<u>not</u>** absolutely pivotal in you solving the problem using programming concept that you learn. Many seasoned data scientists in industry do not fully understand everything which goes under the hood. Don't let that become a hurdle point for you. But make sure that you keep on coming back to fundamentals until they make sense to you, don't abandon this effort.
* Make your own notes , despite having all this material given to you. Making your own notes is one very efficient way for your brain to retain the concepts that you are going through . 

Good luck with all the learning , and let us know if you find any issues or have any suggestions : https://github.com/lalitsachan/text-courses/issues
